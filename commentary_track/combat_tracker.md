# Combat Tracker: commentary track

## Scope 1: keeping track of rounds and phases

### Session 1
*   combatant â‰  participation
*   extra RESTful actions
*   (no) captured groups in Capybara matchers
*   Round.next instead of a model/service

### Session 2
*   Big redesign
*   Conventions for CSS
*   /!\ propshaft and asset URLs
*   Clever stuff for the form layout

### Session 3
*   Actions
*   STI in order to have _types_
*   Polymorphic-like routes & resolve
*   Design adjustements: box shadow so that the grey background is visible
*   Tricky stuff: adjustable activity, variable activity range, removing vs. disabling suggested actions
